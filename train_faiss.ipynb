      "CONTENT: I have a set of stainless steel pans that I absolutely love, and my 12\" frying pan has received LOTS of use since I bought it. This is my first ever stainless steel pan and I'm pretty aware of all the ways to clean it (deglazing, barkeeps friend, etc). Recently, my wife purchased some scotch-bright heavy duty sponges with good intentions but I didn't realize exactly how \"heavy duty\" they were. I was washing my frying pan one night and used the scouring side of the sponge to get some stuck on grease and I noticed that I actually scratched my pan. The scratches don't look very deep, but I'm a little concerned.\n",

I'm wondering, since it is not marked with a metal grade such as 18/10 but instead claims \"restaurant quality\", if this is junk?\n",
      "The scratches appear as black marks, not simply scratches in the stainless steel, and do not rub out with scrubber or baking soda. Is there only a very thin metal coating over something inferior that I do not want my food to touch?\n",
      "The surface is also a dull grey, not a bright shiny color as I am accustomed to in my other stainless steel cookware.  I've had all my other stainless steel pans for 30+ years and never seen anything like this. I smell a rat!\n",
      "Please comment on whether you'd return this set and look for a higher quality set. My purpose is to slow roast tomatoes and I want to avoid contact with reactive metals and also make most efficient use of my oven, as this takes 10-12 hours.\n",

      "CONTENT: I recently started to research into my cookwares and decided a stainless-steel pan was a good budget investment to learn to cook better my steaks and other items. I cooked my first steaks over the last few weeks and they were great, they didn't stick and came out delicious.\n",
      "FYI: usually I cook the steak by seasoning it with some olive oil rubbed in then salting\n",
      "and peppering it and letting it rest till it is at room temperature. To cook it I bring the\n",
      "pan to high heat until droplets of water slip on it as if they were mercury, add a tbsp of\n",
      "oil and place the steak on, reverse it after about 3min with tongs and remove after about\n",
      "another 3 min. The cuts I use are often thin.\n",
      "\n",
      "However there is one problem I have not been able to get over; the steak does not stick but its seasoning will and over the cooking period burns. This causes smoke and a real headache to clean while trying not to use a scourer side of a sponge or metal wire as I have been adamantly told it will ruin the pan's surface (this got me thinking... read on)!\n",
      "So over to my question which may be a little out the box, I am a materials engineer with access to metal work machines, to my knowledge a perfectly flat surface offers less surface area to stick so if I were to buffet the pan until it were nicely polished on the surface (currently I can see all the circular grooves from the fabrication process such as you see on brushed steel) would this help reduce the sticking? Or can I simply improve the way I cook the steak and avoid the seasoning sticking and burning?\n",
