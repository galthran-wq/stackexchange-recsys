You can also find wider and lower moulds for the same dough sizes (or upt to 1 kg / 2.2 lb). \\nYou can find those measures in most webs in italian. Also, if you buy an already made panettone it will quite probably have those or very similar measures.\\nIn general, you can use the formula:\\n\\nDough weight (gr) = 1,45 x Mould volume (cm3)\\n\\nFormula calculated empirically. You can check some values in this italian forum.\\n\\nWhen you pour the dough in the mould it will only be filled up to ¼ or ⅓. It needs to rise a lot: above the upper part of the mould. \\nHere you have a Youtube video on making a homemade mould.\\nAnd this page shows you how to do the mould yourself. It\\'s in Spanish, but you can translate it automatically.\\n\\nSidenote: Orthodox stress they should be done with lievito naturale (sourdough), not yeasts. Non orthodox italian standard accept only up to 0.01% of yeast.\\n'"

We\\'ll be at a mountain station that has limited supplies (e.g. meat) for sale every couple of days, but ideally I want to carry as much food as possible (buying food in the wilderness is expensive!). We\\'ll be walking 15-20 kilometres a day. We\\'ll be cooking food on a small gas burner (can only cook one thing at a time). |              11 |                 660 |                    11 |                      5 | I need a bit of variety and more simplicity in my cooking.  My 25 minute chicken curry is great, but it can get a bit frantic since I often leave cooking until I am very hungry (studying takes precedence over eating most days).  However, I can\\'t live without fresh food.  Packaged stuff makes me feel sluggish after a few days.                                                                                                                                                                              |            9 |                   16 |           4000      |               5 | I think tasty is the easy part - especially when backpacking, anything substantial is going to taste pretty darn good, and if you carry a couple packets of spices with you to dump into meals, they\\'ll probably be like manna from heaven. Variety, though, that\\'s tougher. While this is a very interesting question, it is not a good fit for Seasoned Advice. If there were a stackexchange site for camping/hiking it would be better suited there. We are not equipped to address a 12 day meal plan, nor do we offer advice on _what_ to eat. Although I\\'d agree that if there were a hiking/camping site, it would be more appropriate, there isn\\'t one, and this relates just as much to cooking as questions like [meat dishes for college students](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/2706/) , [cooking for one](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/11075/), [cooking for large groups](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/402/)  or [once a month cooking](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/149/) I\\'ve voted to re-open this, as I think it still relates to cooking, but even if it does get re-opened, you might get more authoritative information from the various backpacking sites; You might try something like [Trail Forums](http://www.trailforums.com/), which is for long-distance hikers (eg, people trying to hike the *whole* Appalachian Trail in one go).  I\\'m guessing that there are other sites out there.  (I haven\\'t done anything other than stationary camping in some time, and that\\'s typically only 3-4 days at a stretch) and you might want to see the discussion at http://meta.cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/1124 |                        2004 |                       5 | As a college student, what gear do you have available?  Just a hot plate, or an oven, microwave, etc? I am moving to grad school, but I understand we have a stove (I presume hotplate) and an oven, I will make sure I have a microwave, and I will get me a rice cooker.  I\\'m contemplating a cheap slowcooker too, since it\\'s like $15 bucks and I only have to use it for a good meal a handful of times to get my money\\'s worth out of it. I also intend to build up a full complement of good thick cast iron pots and pans, since I am very very jealous of my dad\\'s set which he still has almost thirty years and four countries after he finished grad school. If you\\'re living as the poor grad student, consider hitting yard/garage/car boot sales to look for cast iron.  Even the nasty looking ones you can get cheap, then put \\'em in the hot coals of a fireplace, let cool, scour with a wire brush, clean, and re-season. @Joe thanks, but I\\'m not exactly a poor grad student for at least a year.  Our stipend (with teaching) is close to $2100 a month, less $700 (!!!) rent.  After undergrad, I feel like I\\'m inheriting a kingdom. |\\n|       |              |         |             |               |                | I\\'ve never hiked for more than 3 days before and I\\'m at a loss on how to plan to feed the both of us for that length of time. Whatever I bring needs to be low on weight/space taken up, and yet be high in energy and nutritional content. And preferably so that I can use the same ingredients for different meals. I don\\'t want to bring something that I\\'m only going to use once.               |                 |                     |                       |                        | For veggies I usually sautee some spinach with salt, garlic and sesame, but I need a meat dish that I can prepare quickly in advance and preferably in large quantities.  I was thinking of a slow cooker, but I need a good recipe to go with that.

The previous question was restricted to vegan substitutes (which would invalidate my answer) and also didn\\'t specify the context (recipe) requiring the substitution, so the answers were all over the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                          40 |                       2 | Veganizing it and improving the quality are pretty much contradictory goals: cake recipes are tricky and finely tuned. I wouldn\\'t try to adapt an existing recipe. Instead, take a recipe that was developed to be vegan from the start and make that instead. You\\'ll probably have a superior product in the end.

Each well is a vertical half of the seated teddy-bear.  When it is done you trim the cake with a knife then glue the halves together with icing.  This recipe makes a basic vanilla flavoured cake which is a bit on the dry side.  When it\\'s slathered in mocha icing the dryness is ok but when I use fondant icing to decorate it\\'s too dry overall.                                                                                                                |              |                      |                     |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             |                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\n|       |              |         |             |               |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                 |                     |                       |                        | This year I want to make a bear cake again, however there are two changes I need to make.  First, I\\'d like to make the cake moister without sacrificing its physical durability (it needs to be able to sit up without crumbling apart).  Second, I need to replace the milk, eggs, and butter with non-dairy/non-eggs because my new son is allergic to milk and eggs.  I\\'d ask two separate questions but I think they both need to be addressed at the same time.                                                 |              |                      |                     |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             |                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\n|       |              |         |             |               |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                 |                     |                       |                        | How can I make this cake better tasting AND vegan?

My problem is that even using a well-sharpened knife, it gums up both the blade and the cutting board quite a bit.    Is there some method of treating the blade or the candied ginger that would ease cutting it some?                 |               2 |                 762 |                     2 |                      2 | I was born in 1936 and my mother bought a small aluminum ( 6.5 inches in diameter ) cauldre, thus it is my own age, 75 years old. It had a beautifull black patina on the outside and to make a long story short, somebody in my family found it and removed all this patina and painted some ridicolous flowers on it. To do this the patina was removed ( maybe with sandpaper ). Now this item is again in my posesion and I removed the ridicolous flowers and now the small cauldre is shining aluminum color.  |            4 |                    2 |             33.6667 |               3 | Have you tried freezing the ginger?

As @FuzzyChef says, it\\'s quite difficult to chop frozen, and isn\\'t any less gummy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                           5 |                       2 | Can you describe the patina, and what type of stove it had been used on?  I ask, because I suspect that it\\'s deposits from the fuel used (gas or wood).  If that\\'s the case, it\\'ll lessen as it goes up the sides.  It\\'s most pronounced when the flames really lick the sides of the pot. It may have also been a heavy layer of Aluminum Oxide, which would naturally form over time.  Though in that case, it would be a very dark gray, rather than black.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\\n|       |              |         |             |               |                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                 |                     |                       |                        | I would like to ADD a black patina on it, on the OUTSIDE.

The problem is they always end up as a meringue, or looking like cookies.  They usually don\\'t have the \"feet\" that macarons are known for.  My success rate on every recipe I\\'ve tried is about 1 in 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |            7 |                   13 |              0      |               1 | I thought they were cheesy macarons.. ;)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                           2 |                       1 | Are you talking about macarons de Paris?

I set my stainless-steel pan on the burner and set the burner about halfway between medium and high. After the panned warmed on quite a bit (probably all the way), I put some ghee in the pan.

I think the question is incomplete as we don\\'t know whether OPs motives are to simply to preserve his skillets as well as possible, or if OPs intent is to actually produce the best-tasting food.

What is the remedy for this? According to some of the answers to this question, I should either be putting in the ghee (or oil) into a cold pan or warming it or putting it into the pan once it\\'s slightly warm, but not hot.                                                                                             |                 |                     |                       |                        | I personally heat up the pan first, then put the oil in and after it\\'s heated up add the ingredients.  I go with the line of reasoning that doing it this way gives the oil less time to burn, thinking that if you do it the other way, by the time the pan and oil has heated up, the oil could already be starting to burn.                                                                                                                                                                                       |              |                      |                     |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                             |                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\\n|       |              |         |             |               |                | I found the \"Do you heat the pan first?\" question somewhat helpful, but the answers don\\'t really give scientific reasons for their responses.
